# <ins>WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION IN AWS</ins> 
## Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP - LAMP STACK
Welcome to my first project! In this project, I will be exploring the use of technology stack to create different solutions possible to deploy our applications, websites etc. A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. They are specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.
The fuctionality of the Stack is hereby listed as:

| STACK | FUNCTION |
| - | - |
| Linux | Operating Sysytem |
| Apache| Web Server |
| MySQL | Database |
| PHP | Programing Language |

Before I get into the fundamentals, I created an AWS account and also created a IAM User for the account. It is best practice to access the AWS account as a user rather than accessing it as a root user.
